**Restart computer** - The computer restarts the operating system on the local and remote computers.

You can use the parameters of **Restart computer** to run a restart operation, to specify an authentication level and optional credentials, to limit operations that can run at the same time, and to force an immediate restart.

You can wait for the restart to complete before running the next command. Specify the wait time-out and query interval, and wait for particular services to become available on the restarted computer. This feature makes it practical to use restart-computer in scripts and functions.

## How to Restart a MacBook Pro: Apple Menu

**_Maybe the easiest way to restart a MacBook Pro is to click a few menus available from pretty much every screen on a Mac. Here's what to do:_**

* Click the Apple menu in the top left corner of the screen, then select Restart.
* If you want all of your apps and documents to reopen after the restart, check the box next to Reopen windows when logging back in.
* Click **Restart computer** or let the timer count down to complete the restart.

## How to Restart a MacBook Pro: Keyboard

**_If you prefer it or your MacBook Pro isn't responding to mouse clicks, you can restart it using the keyboard. Here's what to do:_**

* Hold down the Control + Command + power/eject/Touch ID button simultaneously until the screen darkens and the restart sound plays. After the sound plays, let go of the keys and let the MacBook start up again. This method works on every MacBook Pro model.
* You can also hold down Control + eject button to get the shutdown dialog box to appear on the screen on some models. From that dialog, click Restart.
* If neither of those options work, try a Force Restart by holding down Control + Option + Command + the power/eject/Touch ID button.

## How to Properly Restart a Router & Modem

* Unplug the router and the modem. If you have other managed network hardware, such as network switches, unplug that hardware. Unmanaged devices can be left powered on, but use your judgment if you think these might be part of the problem.
* Wait at least 30 seconds. This time lets the devices cool down and indicates to your ISP, computers, and other devices that the router and modem are offline.
 * This step may not be necessary if you know what the problem is with the connection. **Restart computer** the router and modem when you don't know what's wrong.
* Plug in the modem. If it doesn't power on in the first few seconds, press the Power button.
 * The modem is the device that your connection to the internet attaches to. For example, with cable-based internet service, the modem attaches to the coax cable from outside the home.
* Wait at least 60 seconds. During this time, the modem authenticates with your ISP and is assigned a public IP address.
* Plug in the router. Some routers may require that you press a Power button. On a combination modem-router, skip this and the next step. * The software in that device initiates things in the proper order.
 * The router is physically connected to the modem, so the device next to the modem is probably the router. Not all routers have an antenna, but many do, so if you see one or more of those, that's probably the router.
* Wait at least 2 minutes. This gives the router time to boot up. It also gives computers, smartphones, and other devices that use the network time to get new private IP addresses assigned by the DHCP service in the router.
 * If you turned off the power for switches or other network hardware, power those back on. Then, wait a minute. If you have several devices, power them on from the outside-in, based on your network map.
* When the router and modem restart, test to see if the problem went away.
